Requirements to run:
-
- Python 3.11.x
- Django 5.x

Current status:
-
Accessing sql database & statics works while debug=True.
Debug=False passes that functionality to Apache, which is currently not implemented.

IMPORTANT:
-
Along with the code in this repo there is also a 21.6 GB 'media' folder that contains... images of the chips, i think? I can't tell what is accessing it.
If you run into issues and need to scp that to your local device, the directory is located on hep01 under the filepath /hep01-data1/hep06-copy/django/testing_database_he/ and is named 'media'.
Should be placed next to your github repo folder in a folder named 'QIE_media' for the program to locate it. 
Not including it in the github repo because github did not like it when i tried to push a 86,000 file commit...
